## The Final Project 

The final project is a large-scale application that should showcase your abilities as a developer and be the capstone of your portfolio. You will present the application on Demo Day.

The purpose of the final project is to showcase your abilities as a developer, not to create the Next Big Thing (if you can do both, kudos). Make sure to decide beforehand what you think your greatest strengths are, and use your application and presentation as a platform to showcase those strengths. Together, your final project and portfolio should tell a story about what sets you apart from other developers, so that you can stand out when seeking employment.

For example, if you have graphic design background, you should nail the graphic design, in addition to the technical aspects, so that you can tell the story of your diverse experience. If you have business acumen, you could develop an idea that shows your ability to create a viable business idea and execute a minimum viable product quickly. This doesn't have to be anything spectacular, just choose some strength about yourself that you can showcase with the application idea or the technical choices you make. Ask your instructor if you need help with this.

## Requirements

1. Make regular commits each day (at least one commit per person per day)  
    1. **_Failure to commit will forfeit graduation_**
2. Build a web API in Django (Python)
3. Use data stored in a database
4. Build a user interface in React (JavaScript)
5. Implement CRUD functionality
6. Integrate at least one 3rd party API
7. Include user authentication and authorization, unless you receive written permission from the instructor not to
8. Use at least one technology or package we haven't covered in class
9. Include at least one (1) image upload
10. Build responsive UI that works on both desktop and mobile
11. Your Project proposal to your instructor must start with an elevator pitch:  
    1. 15 to 25 words of what your app does
12. Before starting development, you must create wireframes (hand sketches are fine)
13. You must document at least 8 User Stories about your app  
    1. "As an admin user, I want the ability to create courses so that learners can see what courses are available."
    2. User stories follow this structure: "As a ________ I want _______ so that ________"
14. Your application must have tests
15. You must write a README that lists all the technologies and APIs used in the project.
16. Your application must be deployed to Heroku and the URL for the deployed site should be in your README and in your repo description.

## Pitching The Projects

Start thinking about final projects ahead of time, and meet with your instructor if you're devoid of ideas.

Make sure your projects are centered around things you truly care about; bee-keeping, beer, dancing, hiking, basketball, etc. This makes a huge difference and can make the project a lot of fun.

## Ask Your Peers for Feedback

Community feedback is invaluable in keeping scope-creep (a.k.a kitchen sink syndrome) out and making sure the projects are the right mix of ambition, talent, feasibility, and hubris (a careful mixture of all four is required, IMHO). 

Peer code reviews are also extremely helpful.
